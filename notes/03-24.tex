\subsection{Dihedral Group}

Today will mostly be exam review, but before this, let's introduce a new group! This will be the symmetries of a square.

To think about this, let's consider a square cushion. We can do a couple things with this (besides sitting on it). The first thing we can do is consider rotating the cushion. If we label the corners, we see that we can see these moves as permutations of the corners. We call this group $D_4$ which is the symmetries of a square and a subgroup of $S_4$.\\
